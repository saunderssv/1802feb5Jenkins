You should avoid hard coding numbers in loops when the terminations condition can be easily retrieved from the size of the array

qThree:
output:

reversed is technically a temporary variable

qFour: 4/4 tests passed
output: N/A

Again like in question two you are using hard-coded (magic numbers) you should avoid that.
        int product = 1;
        if(n<0){
            System.out.println("Can't compute a negative factorial.");
        }if(n==0){
            System.out.println(1); <-- this should be System.out.println(product) since ultimately product will be the return of the method anyway;
        }
